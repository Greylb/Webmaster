<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p> Here Green Energy Solutions, we have one goal, to make the Earth cleaner and greener for all the future generations to come. While this is issue may seem daunting and huge with so many avenues to why the Earth has turned less and less healthy, we tackle this issue by bringing awareness to what the average person could do to help avert the looming crisis. This would be homeowners switching to more efficient and cleaner energy sources to power their homes and lives. Our mission with this website is to raise awareness to homeowners about how to change to cleaner energy solutions and the benefits of these cleaner energy solutions, as they benefit not only the Earth, but the homeowners as well!!!</p>
<h3> Meet the team </h3>
</p>We are a group of four highschool students based out of Parker, Colorado. We made this website because we've seen how the Earth has been affected by global warming with harsher weather, and so we wanted to create a website that gave the average person a way to make a small change in their lifestyle for an impactful benefit of our beautiful planet. </p>
